Make the code modular
make reusable components
More UI -> break into component
more logic -> break into custom hooks
handle auth flow
token handling
token expire handling


AUTH 'STATE' LIVES IN UserContext
Axios handles token failure globally
2️⃣ What Is ACTUALLY Missing (Important)
❌ Nothing stops the page from rendering first

Right now:

MovieDescription2 renders fully

UI is shown

Effects run

Then API fails

THEN redirect happens

This causes:

❌ Protected UI flash
❌ Side effects running for unauthenticated users
❌ Business logic executing before auth check

This is not safe.
